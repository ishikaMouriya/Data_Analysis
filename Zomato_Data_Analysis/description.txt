Project Description: Zomato Data Analysis

Objective:

This project focuses on analyzing restaurant data from Zomato to derive insights regarding customer ratings, restaurant categories, online/offline orders, and cost distribution. The analysis leverages Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
I have imported data with the use of read_csv.

This project is strong in terms of applying foundational data analysis techniques to solve real-world business problems, particularly in the restaurant and food delivery industry.


Strengths of this project:
Data Handling: The project demonstrates your ability to clean and preprocess data (e.g., handling ratings), which is essential in the real world where data can be messy and unstructured.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The use of visualizations (count plots, histograms, box plots) shows that you understand how to explore data and uncover meaningful insights.

Real-World Relevance: The insights derived from this project (e.g., spending patterns, restaurant ratings, and online orders) are highly relevant to the food industry and could help businesses make data-driven decisions.




Code Breakdown and Real-Life Relevance

1.Handling Ratings Data:
code:-
def handleRate(value):
    value = str(value).split('/')
    value = value[0]
    return float(value)
dataframe['rate'] = dataframe['rate'].apply(handleRate)

Real-Life Problem:
 Restaurants often have a rating system where ratings are provided as "X/Y" (e.g., 4.5/5). This analysis addresses the issue of extracting meaningful data by converting these ratings into a standardized numeric format.

Relevance:
 This data preprocessing step is crucial in customer satisfaction analysis and helps in quantifying restaurant performance based on reviews. It could be used to help restaurant managers evaluate customer satisfaction and adjust their services accordingly.


2.Restaurant Type Distribution:
code:-
sns.countplot(x=dataframe['listed_in(type)'])

Real-Life Problem:
 Restaurants are categorized under different types like "Dining", "Cafes", etc. Understanding the distribution of restaurant types helps businesses make decisions on the market share and competition.

Relevance: 
Identifying the most popular restaurant types can guide restaurant owners in tailoring their services, promotions, and operations for increased market penetration.


3.Votes by Restaurant Type:
code:-
grouped_data = dataframe.groupby("listed_in(type)")['votes'].sum()
result = pd.DataFrame({'votes': grouped_data})
plt.plot(result, c="green", marker="o")

Real-Life Problem:
 The number of votes is a good indicator of customer engagement. Analyzing votes by type allows businesses to identify which restaurant categories attract the most attention and which may need improvement in customer outreach.

Relevance:
 This helps companies identify which restaurant types have a higher volume of customer interaction, indicating higher popularity or quality.


4.Ratings Distribution:
code:-
plt.hist(dataframe['rate'], bins=5)

Real-Life Problem:
 Analyzing the distribution of ratings helps understand how consistently customers are rating the restaurants. A narrow rating distribution might suggest that customers are generally satisfied, whereas a wide distribution may point to varied experiences.

Relevance: 
The insights from this plot could help restaurants fine-tune their customer experience and identify areas for improvement to increase consistency in ratings.


5.Cost Distribution for Couples:
code:-
sns.countplot(x=dataframe["approx_cost(for two people)"])

Real-Life Problem: 
Understanding spending patterns for different types of customers (e.g., couples) helps restaurants adjust their menu and pricing strategies to attract a particular target audience.

Relevance:
 This analysis helps restaurant owners better position themselves for couples by adjusting the average pricing and offering targeted promotions.


 6.Comparing Online vs. Offline Orders:
code:-
sns.boxplot(x="online_order", y="rate", data=dataframe)

Real-Life Problem:
 Restaurants today need to evaluate whether online orders provide a better customer experience than offline orders. This analysis offers insights into the ratings given by customers who order online versus those who dine in.

Relevance:
 This helps businesses adjust their service models. If online orders have better ratings, they might focus more on optimizing online ordering platforms, delivery services, and menu offerings for online customers.


7.Heatmap: Online Orders by Restaurant Type:
code:-
pivot_table = dataframe.pivot_table(index='listed_in(type)', columns='online_order', aggfunc='size', fill_value=0)
sns.heatmap(pivot_table, annot=True, cmap="YlGnBu", fmt='d')


Real-Life Problem: 
The analysis of online vs. offline orders by restaurant type helps understand consumer behavior. For example, customers may prefer offline ordering at restaurants with a more formal dining experience and online ordering at casual eateries or cafes.
Relevance:
 This insight helps restaurants optimize their ordering platforms and adjust their marketing strategies to cater to the preferences of different customer segments.
